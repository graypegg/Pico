Pico [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toish/Pico.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/toish/Pico)
======
**Pico** is a very small, esoteric programming language in the same vain as [brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

### Getting Started
Installing Pico is easy, just run:

1.`$ cabal configure`

2.`$ cabal install`

and you should have a binary installed in ~/.cabal/bin! You may need to add this directory to your PATH variable before it works as a command.

After that, you can start making your first Pico program! Make a new file with your favourite editor ending with a .pco extension, and type this in:

`"Hello World!"`

Now run it with Pico by passing the path of that file you just made into the script:

`$ pico ~/your/file/here`

Congratulations! You made you're first Pico program, wasn't that hard was it?

### Now what?
